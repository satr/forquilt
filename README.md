# forquilt
ForQuilt is designed to assist people who has a hobby or a job related to quilting.   This product made on WPF and may be useful for software developers.

The project uses Canvas to draw lines, manipulate its properties. It also can take pictures from a webcam (if connected to a PC) and put it on the Canvas for further usage (using a library DirectShowLib-2005.dll). It were tried to use OpenCV and other libraries, but this one fit best for this particular task.
